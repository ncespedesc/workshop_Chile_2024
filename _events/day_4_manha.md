_Simulate FMD introduction and spread from swine, bovine, and small ruminant populations_
1. Seed infections and estimate epidemic trajectories.
2. Implement control and eradication actions.
3. Extract model outputs for decision-making.
4. Using the model outputs, propose the next steps for elimination.

_Simulation of alternative control scenarios_

1. Change control zone sizes.
2. Contact tracing of movement networks. 
3. Increase the duration of control zones and surveillance activities.
